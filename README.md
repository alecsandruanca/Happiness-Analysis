# Happiness-Analysis


In this project I am trying to analyse the Happinnes around the globe using Principal Component Analysis and K-Means Clustering analysis.
The scope of it is interpreting the positive or negative affect that GDP, Life Expectancy(due to the Healthcare System), Social support or Freedom and Generosity in a certain country have on the overall level of Happiness in that country.

The Principal Component Analysis tell us that almost 80% in the variation of the Happiness Score is ixplained by the variation of only 3 Principal Components.
